# This program knows about the RGB code corresponding to common colours.
#
# Usage:
#
# $ python rgb_colours.py [colour]
#
# For instance:
#
# $ python rgb_colours.py red
# The RGB code for red is F00
#
# or:
#
# $ python rgb_colours.py "burnt sienna"
# I don't know the RGB code for burnt sienna

# TODO:
# * Implement the program as described in the comments at the top of the file.

# TODO (extra):
# * Change the program so that users can also enter an RGB colour code, and be
#   told the name of the corresponding colour.
# * Change the program so that it ignores the case of the user's input.
